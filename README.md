White matter simulation toolbox

This toolbox is related to a paper available on biorxiv
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.127258v1

This matlab toolbox has 2 main purposes 

(1) Create 2D WM models with chosen microstructure parameters using realistic axon shapes. 

(2) Simulate the field perturbation and the corresponding multi GRE signal from a 2D or 3D WM model.
